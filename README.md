"# UCL2024" 
All my code I did while working as a research assistant at UCL!!
Started off as my little knife edge profile and fitting program, then some bits of data, then a bunch of calculations and benchmarking for feasability and design and stuff!!!
Cutest and best repository for the cutest and best RA <3
